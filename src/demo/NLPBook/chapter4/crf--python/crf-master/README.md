Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
===============================

Setup
-----

You will need to grab my [arsenal](https://github.com/timvieira/arsenal)
repository and stick it on your python path.

Example data for citation segmentation is included as well as very simple
feature extraction (not a serious feature set).


TODO
----

 - Regularization

 - L-BFGS optimization

 - Parameter averaging for sgd and perceptron


Third Party Copyright
---------------------

The example dataset `tagged_references.txt` is due to Andrew McCallum. It is
available [here](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data.html).
